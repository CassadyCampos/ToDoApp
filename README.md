# ToDoApp
ToDo List type program I created to implement my new learning of jQuery. Small basic App that lets you create new tasks, check off created tasks and delete any task whether it was completed or not. 
## Usage

#### Add Task
To add a new task type the task you want to add in the "Next Task" form and press enter. The new task will be added at the bottom of the list.

#### Completed Task
To indicate that a task is completed simply click the task and it will be greyed out and crossed off.

#### Delete Task
To delete a task hover over the task you wish to delete. This will reveal the delete button on the left of the task which you can click. You can delete a task whether or not it is complete.
